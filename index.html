                  agnostic components. This ensures interface/experience

    "Java - Experience: 5 years. Out of the programming languages that I have learned, I am currently most experienced in Java. Most of my Computer Science education has used Java as the Object Oriented language of choice for learning about concepts like data structures and algorithms. As a result, I have worked on various interesting class projects including: creating a game engine and then using that game engine to create a game (JavaFX Library), coding and visualizing fractal curves, a postfix and infix calculator, many projects that involve creating, manipulating, and utilizing data structures and algorithms, and more. Furthermore, I also have some beginner experience with using Java in coding Android applications.",
    "C - Experience: 1 year. I am relatively new to the C programming language, however, I am still very comfortable in using it for various tasks. My introduction to the C programming language was with a Computer Systems class, in which I learned a lot about pointers, memory allocation, file I/O, control flow, the preprocessor, memory hierarchy and virtual memory, cache placement, signals, processes, threads (multithreaded programming), pipes and FIFOs, networking and socket programming, and more. I used the C programming language for various class challenges and class projects. Some of the projects that I have programmed in C are: Santorini (the board game), Clue (the board game), Wordfreak - efficiently counts the occurrences of every word in a document, Presidential Debate Simulation - Threads project which simulates phone calls and utilizes tools like semaphores. Socket - Networking project that involves connecting to a specified address and port, receiving a math problem, calculating the answer, and sending it back.",
    "C# - Experience: 2 years. The experience that I have with the C# programming language has been with Unity Game Engine. I have utilized the C# programming language to program games (personal projects). Some of these games include: Pocket Planet - a tycoon type game which aims to teach users about the long term benefits of investing in clean and sustainable energy, Jumpman - a basic 2D Platformer game, and Speedio - a third person racing game. Overall, I am very comfortable with the C# programming language and deeply understand the fundamentals, however I have not utilized the C# programming language in any setting other than Game Development.",

    "CSS3 - Experience: 3 years. I have utilized CSS with HTML to style websites.",
    "JavaScript - Experience: 2 years. I was first introduced to JavaScript in a Programming Methodologies class. In this class, I learned about Functional Programming, Image Processing, Higher Order Functions, Design Patterns, parsing and utilizing JSON data, and Interpreters. I used JavaScript for various projects including: Image Processing - blurring, filtering, saturating, grayscaling, etc., Oracle - algorithm that calculates the best way to match employers to employees based on their preferences, Builders and JSON - finds the best restauraunt given specified filters (such as location, reviews, etc) from Yelp data, Interpreter - programmed an interpreter, FSA - uses the memento design pattern to keep track of and store state data. \n\nFurthermore I have experience programming in JavaScript for websites. This includes React web application programming.",
    "TypeScript - Experience: under 1 year. The experience that I have with TypeScript involves using the Angular framework to program web applications. So far, I have used TypeScript to implement a data vizualization (using the D3.js library). I am very comfortable with TypeScript's syntax and will definitely be developing more experience with this language.",
    "Angular - Experience: under 1 year. I have used Angular to work on implementing a Data Visualization feature into a web application.",
    "D3.js - Experience: under 1 year. I have used D3.js to implement a circle packing vector graphic into a React web application (transitioned from Angular). My experience using D3 is limited, however I look forward to using it on future personal projects.",
    "Linux - Experience: 1 year. My experience with Linux comes with using UMass's EdLab service, which is a remotely accessible Linux based educational laboratory. I have experience managing and working on projects with Linux and the command line in various settings.",
